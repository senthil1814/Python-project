This study explores the relationships between life expectancy, social support, and the happiness
index across countries. The primary goal is to determine whether social support and happiness
scores influences the life expectancy of populations.
The findings from this analysis could help pinpoint areas where interventions would be most impactful, such as strengthening community support systems or implementing policies designed to
enhance societal happiness.
By examining these critical factors, this analysis provides valuable insights into the determinants
of life expectancy. The results have practical implications for improving global health outcomes
and can contribute meaningfully to both academic research and the development of effective policy
frameworks.
